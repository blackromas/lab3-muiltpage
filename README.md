Page Descriptions

 Home Page (index.html)
The home page features a hero banner with a blurry background image and a welcome message. It uses Flexbox to arrange sections side by side for responsiveness. The navigation bar is styled using CSS Flexbox, and the page includes an animation for the hero section using @keyframes fadeIn. Media queries ensure a responsive layout on different screen sizes Services Page

(services.html)
The services page uses CSS Grid to display service cards, each containing a heading, text, and an icon or image. The cards have hover effects that slightly enlarge them on interaction. The header, footer, and navigation are consistent across all pages. Media queries adjust the grid layout for different screen sizes, ensuring responsiveness.

Contact Page (contact.html)
The contact page features a styled HTML5 form with fields for name, email, subject, and message. It includes HTML5 form validation to ensure correct input submission. CSS transitions enhance user experience with smooth focus and hover effects. The form layout adapts responsively using CSS Flexbox and media queries to ensure usability on all devices.
